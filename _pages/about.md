## Quick Intro

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">
    <p>Hi, and welcome to my page! I'm currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, diving deep (literally and figuratively) into the world of Underwater Robotics. My research is centered on multi-agent systems, data fusion, and machine learning, with the goal of advancing underwater exploration technologies. ü§ñ</p>
    <p>When I‚Äôm not working on robotics or AI, you can find me immersed in music, sports, or creative pursuits. I‚Äôve been a trained Hindustani classical singer for over 12 years, performing and practicing this ancient art form, which brings balance and depth to my life. üé∂</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I‚Äôm also an avid tennis player. üè∏ Tennis is my go-to for staying active and enjoying a good challenge. Whether it‚Äôs a casual match or just hitting balls for fun, I love how the sport keeps me grounded and energized.</p>
  <p>Beyond academics and sports, I‚Äôm also into writing. I find joy in expressing my thoughts through words. Writing helps me think clearly and communicate ideas in a way that resonates with others. üìù</p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdupadhyay/">LinkedIn</a>. I‚Äôd love to hear about your interests and experiences, and maybe even collaborate on a project or two! üöÄ</p>

## Current Role

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>As part of the Underwater Robotics team at KTH, my work focuses on solving challenges in autonomous systems and underwater perception. I'm also fortunate to be a WASP Doctoral Fellow, supported by the <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>, which fuels my passion for robotics and AI.</p>
</div>

## Research Interests

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>My PhD is aligned with <a href="https://www.smarc.se/">SMaRC 2.0</a> ‚Äì Swedish Maritime Robotics Centre's latest initiative. Through SMaRC 2.0, I aim to contribute to the next generation of autonomous underwater systems, working alongside industry leaders like <a href="https://www.saab.com/">Saab</a> and <a href="https://oceaninfinity.com/">Ocean Infinity</a>. The combination of academic research and real-world applications is what excites me most about this field.</p>
</div>

## Background

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning from <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>, where I developed a strong foundation in AI and robotics. My thesis focused on using multi-modal machine learning techniques for fault detection in telecom networks. Previously, I studied Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru</a>, where I explored the beauty of mathematical structures and their applications in the real world. It was here that I developed a strong interest in probability theory, vector spaces, calculus and optimization, which laid the groundwork for my future research in AI.</p>

## Gratitude

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>A special thanks to my supervisor, Professor <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/johnf">John Folkesson</a>, and the entire <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439">RPL (Robotics, Perception and Learning) division at KTH</a>. Their guidance has been invaluable as I take on this new chapter.</p>
</div>

## What's Next?

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I'm looking forward to pushing the boundaries of AI in maritime robotics, collaborating with the brilliant minds in the <a href="https://www.smarc.se/">SMaRC community</a>, and tackling the unique challenges that come with exploring the unknown depths of the ocean.</p>
