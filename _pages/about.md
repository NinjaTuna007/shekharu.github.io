## Quick Intro

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">
    <p>Hi, and welcome to my page! I'm currently a PhD student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), diving deep (literally and figuratively) into the world of Underwater Robotics. My research is centered on multi-agent systems, data fusion, and machine learning, with the goal of advancing underwater exploration technologies. ü§ñ</p>
    <p>When I‚Äôm not working on robotics or AI, you can find me immersed in music, sports, or creative pursuits. I‚Äôve been a trained Hindustani classical singer for over 12 years, performing and practicing this ancient art form, which brings balance and depth to my life. üé∂</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I‚Äôm also an avid tennis player. üè∏ Tennis is my go-to for staying active and enjoying a good challenge. Whether it‚Äôs a casual match or just hitting balls for fun, I love how the sport keeps me grounded and energized.</p>
  <p>Beyond academics and sports, I‚Äôm also into writing. I find joy in expressing my thoughts through words. Writing helps me think clearly and communicate ideas in a way that resonates with others. üìù</p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdupadhyay/). I‚Äôd love to hear about your interests and experiences, and maybe even collaborate on a project or two! üöÄ</p>

## Current Role

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>As part of the Underwater Robotics team at KTH, my work focuses on solving challenges in autonomous systems and underwater perception. I'm also fortunate to be a WASP Doctoral Fellow, supported by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/), which fuels my passion for robotics and AI.</p>
</div>

## Research Interests

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>My PhD is aligned with [SMaRC 2.0](https://www.smarc.se/) ‚Äì Swedish Maritime Robotics Centre's latest initiative. Through SMaRC 2.0, I aim to contribute to the next generation of autonomous underwater systems, working alongside industry leaders like [Saab](https://www.saab.com/) and [Ocean Infinity](https://oceaninfinity.com/). The combination of academic research and real-world applications is what excites me most about this field.</p>
</div>

## Background

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), where I developed a strong foundation in AI and robotics. My thesis focused on using multi-modal machine learning techniques for fault detection in telecom networks. Previously, I studied Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://www.iisc.ac.in/), where I explored the beauty of mathematical structures and their applications in the real world. It was here that I developed a strong interest in probability theory, vector spaces, calculus and optimization, which laid the groundwork for my future research in AI.</p>

## Gratitude

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>A special thanks to my supervisor, Professor [John Folkesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/johnf), and the entire [RPL (Robotics, Perception and Learning) division at KTH](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439). Their guidance has been invaluable as I take on this new chapter.</p>
</div>

## What's Next?

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I'm looking forward to pushing the boundaries of AI in maritime robotics, collaborating with the brilliant minds in the SMaRC community, and tackling the unique challenges that come with exploring the unknown depths of the ocean.</p>
